# your_own_async.py

A custom implementation of an async scheduler implemented in Python (3.5+).

Based on David Beazley's `Build Your Own Async` [tutorial originally presented at PyCon India, Chennai, October 14, 2019.](https://youtu.be/Y4Gt3Xjd7G8)

Each important milestone is broken up into its own Python file, so you can follow along the improvements in numerical order:

- `basic.py`: A countup function and a countdown function.
- `basic_producer_consumer.py`: The classic producer-consumer problem solved with Python's `threading` module.
- `async1.py`
- `async2.py`
- `async3_priority_queue.py`
- `async4_producer_consumer.py`
- `async5_closeable_queue.py`
- `async6_generators.py`
- `async7_awaitable.py`
- `async8_awaitable_sleep.py`
- `async9_producer_consumer.py`
- `async10_closeable_queue.py`
